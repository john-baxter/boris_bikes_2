## Using instance variables
## Step 11

In this challenge, you will pass instances of the Bike class into a DockingStation instance. You will store those Bike instances as an attribute of the DockingStation instance, using an instance variable. Then, use an attribute reader to allow access to the instance variable from the DockingStation public interface.

need a method to dock the bike (bike.dock) which causes some counter inside the docking_station to increase by 1

need a method to check the inventory of the docking station - ie how many (total) bikes are in the dock. specify working/not working later.
